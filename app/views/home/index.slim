      | Hi! This is newsletter that is ran by fine people from
      a href="http://railsreactor.com" RailsReactor
      |  that is focused on gathering interesting links.
    p
      | Main topics would be Ruby, JS, DB, DevOps, mobile development. Occasionally we would drop in links from other areas useful for software engineers (CSS, UX,
      abbr title="Functional Programming" FP
      | , general CS, algorithms) or interesting events (a bit biased geographically because most of the team is located in Kyiv).
